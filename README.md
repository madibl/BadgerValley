This is our project for the Mercile J. Lee Hackathon!

The game is inspired by the 2D RPG game Stardew Valley and was created in under 24 hours with no prior Unity or C# experience.
The hackathon revolved around the pillars of the scholarship program--Scholarship, Leadership, and Service--which is incorporated into the quest of the game.
The only quest implemented so far revolves around service, where the player helps Bucky serve the community by picking up trash. 
Future add-ons include, more quests, a shop, more NPC interaction, a story line, a leveling system, and so on...This is just a rough start to the game!
